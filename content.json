I have taken an UA flight (UA 199) from Shanghai in June 22nd and arrive LAX at June 22nd 16:31(LA local time); after wait for 5h48min we finally get departure from LAX at 22:55. After a nearly 5h flight trip I finally arrived Baltimore in June 23rd! The first day of EI is quite good. Today professor Luana Scheffer give us an experiment assignment in the morning, which is basically fix up the apparatus to prepare for Tension test of different spaghetti. Me and two female working partners set up the apparatus quickly and successfully and it is actually quite fun. In the afternoon, Miss Luana teach us some basic knowledges about material engineering. Stress, Strain, Young��s modulus… I am familiar with about a half of them from the Cambridge A-level Physics textbook, which is taught by Mr. Eric in my school. However, I am not familiar with some brand-new knowledge like Toughness, Yielding, Strength in bending and several relationship formulas. Moreover, I have also learned a new unit: psi, which represents pounds per square. It is almost the same with the unit Pascal, but since Chinese use neither pounds nor inch in our daily life, I feel quite interesting when I first know what is ��psi�� represents, since I have seen them on the bag of Lay��s potato chips. To me, the most challenging part is the new relationship formula I get. The constants and the position of each parameters in the fractions takes time for me to remember. The most unfortunate part in today��s activities is that our group��s spaghetti structure for holding a cotton sugar get collapsed just before the time is up (about 1 or 2 seconds before professor Luana calls ��times up!��). We are given some tape, 20 spaghetti sticks and a cotton thread to create our structure. We can win if the accident doesn��t happens! Really looking forward to tomorrow��s class!

Today is the 2nd day in Engineering Innovation. In the morning class professor Luana introduces us some basic operating technique of excels. Since I am a new fish on excel, although organizing data, performing calculation and visualization is just the most basic function that excel provide, I am so supervised about that. We then get some small exercises which helps me to be familiar with, for example, how to drag values so that I can get a consecutive data set quickly and how to use the formula appropriately so that it can help me to save so much time on calculating the data I need with paper and pen. We then have an assignment, which is a list of 20 hypothetical colleges and 12 pieces of data. Our task is to come out a ranking system with our own logarithms that reflects what I consider most important in a college. By giving different weights to different data, I successfully come out a big chart and a perfect table with universities’ ranking and their marks on it. In the afternoon, we go back to our lab (actually we are in the Computer lab this morning when finishing the “university ranking system” task) where we prepared spaghetti device yesterday for testing different spaghettis’ tensions and bending. Unfortunately, 1 spaghetti and 1 “angel hair” (the thinnest spaghetti) prepared yesterday for testing tensions have already broken. However, Annie, Aysia and me have down perfect experiments. We get the data we want accurately in such a short period of time. One thing that is annoying me that the small steel ball used as weight is just fading, which made my hand turns almost totally black after we finished our experiment. I also went to a special lecture this afternoon, which is related to biomedical engineering. The lecturer, Ms. Soojung Claire Hur, has a legendary study experience and she works so hard that she left her steps in a Korea university, UCLA and Harvard. Now she is currently an Assistant Professor in JHU. Her speech refreshes my idea about biomedical engineering. Biomedical engineering is like a combination of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and Biology, which requires much more hard work than many other subjects like pure electrical engineering. Really looking forward to tomorrow’s class! Kevin/Shi Kaiwen","link":"/2019/06/25/6.25 EN/"},{"title":"June 24th","text":"Today is quite a normal day. Nothing special today except for the fire news about the Maryland Hall. We did part of our material experiment data analysis in the computer lab this morning (unfortunately I am still not finished now (23:46now)) and we studied units and dimensions in the afternoon, which is quite easy. The special lecture is held by a JHU student who studied in Continuum Mechanics, which is another subject that has a partial relationship with biomedical field, which is JHU most good at. Seems like every special lecturer belong to engineering department and they are doing or studying everything related to biomedical engineering. I have even seen a 3D surgical machine in the Hackernet building, in which our computer lab locates in. I walked around the school individually this afternoon to discover the beautiful scenes in Homewood campus, which looks very good and I take a lot of photos of the campus. I also discussed about China’s social media freedom with Gov(I don’t know why he suddenly discuss this with me) tonight. What he always believing is that US has news freedom while China don’t; Chinese people are boring because they can’t use neither YouTube or Netflix. He is even thinking that it is the American people that feed up Japan’s economy. He just believe that Chinese people are under control.

I missed the shopping trip today. My fantastic ASICS is dying, I have wear it for about 10days! Today we have a whole day electronics class &amp; work doing. We have our electronic class in a big lecture hall this morning. There are about 80 people inside of the lecture hall. It is quite big and magnificent. Our lecturer is an Indian-oriented professor, I believe. He is partly bald, as many programmers do. He is very nice, his lecture is actually quite fun because of the funny picture he used like 2-finger-aliens and 8-fingers-cat, which really attracts students. His lecture begun with an introduction of numbers and digital systems. All of these evolve from complicated and primitive system to an easy-to-read and perfect as time goes by. For example, the 2-digit, 8-digit, 10-digit and 16-digit systems. All of them have their own specific characteristics and shows their usage in variety of fields. Old Chinese people use 16-digit weighting systems, computer hardware use binary system to enable computers doing work; 8-digit for bytes and 10-digits in our everyday life. Actually, it is the electronics class that attracts me to this Engineering Innovation Program. I am confident with the logic gates, and the morning introduction courses for the logic gates is OK. However, I am just struggling in the afternoon, the time when we are focusing on dealing with our logic gates assignment. I took nearly an hour with another people’s help to finish question8. That is a shame for me! I am now even having a doubt that am I really good at these things like electrical engineering? Can I be the best among my classmates if I choose electrical engineering in the university? It is just seeming not very possible as I thought before. Today’s special lecture is still something related to medical field. I am just realizing that seems JHU’s Engineering department is just rely on their medical department.

It is already 10 days past since I arrived America, arrived LA, arrived Baltimore, arrived JHU Homewood campus! Today we just have such a normal day. We have done our logic gate CMOS plate design this morning and unfortunately our group become the slowest one. We just don’t know why, although one of our team members have designed such an easy circuit that only contain only 3 NAND gates, which is quite easy and really interesting. Basically, his idea is that since whether left sensor detect lights, the right wheel just keeps moving, so only 3 logic gates is enough for controlling all the thing. We have met some problems about CMOS plate, but fortunately we figure out all the problems and it is working finally. We have truss classes this afternoon. Initially we met with Dr. Luana and Mr. Davis at Maryland Hall 201 to solve the problems that we have on Monday’s class. The truss question was quite difficult for me at first, but when I finally got the idea of ∑Fx, ∑Fy and ∑Momentum all equals 0, I found truss questions are actually easy to solve. We then go to Hackerman Hall to do our Bridge (Truss) Designer Tutorial and practice problems. Initially the truss simulator running on Chrome on the laptop that I am using is just totally dead for 3 different bridges. All of them are just showing errors “too few supports …” I was about to get crazy and I want to just throw away that computer. Fortunately, I get everything I want on Chrome. It is so lucky! Someone (Sam) is saying Edge sucks, but what the hell I should take care of. I went to the swimming pool tonight and meet many nice people. A new fish swimmer is running 100m consecutively each time, which couldn’t make me not to doubt that he is actually a professional swimmer. Jason is another friend I meet. He is also having summer school most in Medical Campus. He speaks Spanish as his first language. From him I have learned that the breaststrokes in Spanish is actually called braza. I swam 600m today, about 12 circles. Except for first two consecutive circles, I finished rest of circles when 1 circle 1 time. I can now finish 100m with about 1’38’’. That is still okay, but is much slower than I can. Hope I can get a nice shoe this week!","link":"/2019/07/03/7.3 EN/"},{"title":"my first article","text":"This is my first blog.
