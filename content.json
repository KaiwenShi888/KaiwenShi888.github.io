I have taken an UA flight (UA 199) from Shanghai in June 22nd and arrive LAX at June 22nd 16:31(LA local time); after wait for 5h48min we finally get departure from LAX at 22:55. After a nearly 5h flight trip I finally arrived Baltimore in June 23rd! The first day of EI is quite good. Today professor Luana Scheffer give us an experiment assignment in the morning, which is basically fix up the apparatus to prepare for Tension test of different spaghetti. Me and two female working partners set up the apparatus quickly and successfully and it is actually quite fun. In the afternoon, Miss Luana teach us some basic knowledges about material engineering. Stress, Strain, Young��s modulus… I am familiar with about a half of them from the Cambridge A-level Physics textbook, which is taught by Mr. Eric in my school. However, I am not familiar with some brand-new knowledge like Toughness, Yielding, Strength in bending and several relationship formulas. Moreover, I have also learned a new unit: psi, which represents pounds per square. It is almost the same with the unit Pascal, but since Chinese use neither pounds nor inch in our daily life, I feel quite interesting when I first know what is ��psi�� represents, since I have seen them on the bag of Lay��s potato chips. To me, the most challenging part is the new relationship formula I get. The constants and the position of each parameters in the fractions takes time for me to remember. The most unfortunate part in today��s activities is that our group��s spaghetti structure for holding a cotton sugar get collapsed just before the time is up (about 1 or 2 seconds before professor Luana calls ��times up!��). We are given some tape, 20 spaghetti sticks and a cotton thread to create our structure. We can win if the accident doesn��t happens! Really looking forward to tomorrow��s class!

Today is the 2nd day in Engineering Innovation. In the morning class professor Luana introduces us some basic operating technique of excels. Since I am a new fish on excel, although organizing data, performing calculation and visualization is just the most basic function that excel provide, I am so supervised about that. We then get some small exercises which helps me to be familiar with, for example, how to drag values so that I can get a consecutive data set quickly and how to use the formula appropriately so that it can help me to save so much time on calculating the data I need with paper and pen. We then have an assignment, which is a list of 20 hypothetical colleges and 12 pieces of data. Our task is to come out a ranking system with our own logarithms that reflects what I consider most important in a college. By giving different weights to different data, I successfully come out a big chart and a perfect table with universities’ ranking and their marks on it. In the afternoon, we go back to our lab (actually we are in the Computer lab this morning when finishing the “university ranking system” task) where we prepared spaghetti device yesterday for testing different spaghettis’ tensions and bending. Unfortunately, 1 spaghetti and 1 “angel hair” (the thinnest spaghetti) prepared yesterday for testing tensions have already broken. However, Annie, Aysia and me have down perfect experiments. We get the data we want accurately in such a short period of time. One thing that is annoying me that the small steel ball used as weight is just fading, which made my hand turns almost totally black after we finished our experiment. I also went to a special lecture this afternoon, which is related to biomedical engineering. The lecturer, Ms. Soojung Claire Hur, has a legendary study experience and she works so hard that she left her steps in a Korea university, UCLA and Harvard. Now she is currently an Assistant Professor in JHU. Her speech refreshes my idea about biomedical engineering. Biomedical engineering is like a combination of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and Biology, which requires much more hard work than many other subjects like pure electrical engineering. Really looking forward to tomorrow’s class!

Nothing special today except for the fire news about the Maryland Hall. We did part of our material experiment data analysis in the computer lab this morning (unfortunately I am still not finished now (23:46now)) and we studied units and dimensions in the afternoon, which is quite easy. The special lecture is held by a JHU student who studied in Continuum Mechanics, which is another subject that has a partial relationship with biomedical field, which is JHU most good at. Seems like every special lecturer belong to engineering department and they are doing or studying everything related to biomedical engineering. I have even seen a 3D surgical machine in the Hackernet building, in which our computer lab locates in. I walked around the school individually this afternoon to discover the beautiful scenes in Homewood campus, which looks very good and I take a lot of photos of the campus. I also discussed about China’s social media freedom with Gov(I don’t know why he suddenly discuss this with me) tonight. What he always believing is that US has news freedom while China don’t; Chinese people are boring because they can’t use neither YouTube or Netflix. He is even thinking that it is the American people that feed up Japan’s economy. He just believe that Chinese people are under control. I just have no idea how to wake up such a man who only lives inside of his personal opinion and never change it.

The inner Harbor. The second Saturday in Baltimore (although actually I am only able to enjoy 3 Saturday here, which means a lot time passed!). We simply stayed at our dorm whole morning, and we went to The Inner Harbor in the afternoon. 4 of us travel as a group took a small boat to travel on the water to see the Inner Harbor, which spend us 25$. The Inner Harbor has quite a long history, which can be observed from the old 19th century aircraft carrier mooring inside the Inner Harbor. The Inner Harbor doesn’t have many places to visit or to play. We went to several shoe stores and I found that the same AJ13 is 50$ cheaper at the Gallery than that in the shoe store. I think myself really lucky because I didn’t buy it from shoe store which saves 50$, but the staff says they don’t have my size. What a pity! For other shoes, either too ugly or no my size. We went to a book store then and bought some sale books, which is quite cheap ($5 for 1 book but tax 6%). One is This Side of Paradise by F. Scott Fitzgerald and another is the picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. Both of them write in English, which is the reason why I bought these two books.

I missed the shopping trip today. My fantastic ASICS is dying, I have wear it for about 10days! Today we have a whole day electronics class &amp; work doing. We have our electronic class in a big lecture hall this morning. There are about 80 people inside of the lecture hall. It is quite big and magnificent. Our lecturer is an Indian-oriented professor, I believe. He is partly bald, as many programmers do. He is very nice, his lecture is actually quite fun because of the funny picture he used like 2-finger-aliens and 8-fingers-cat, which really attracts students. His lecture begun with an introduction of numbers and digital systems. All of these evolve from complicated and primitive system to an easy-to-read and perfect as time goes by. For example, the 2-digit, 8-digit, 10-digit and 16-digit systems. All of them have their own specific characteristics and shows their usage in variety of fields. Old Chinese people use 16-digit weighting systems, computer hardware use binary system to enable computers doing work; 8-digit for bytes and 10-digits in our everyday life. Actually, it is the electronics class that attracts me to this Engineering Innovation Program. I am confident with the logic gates, and the morning introduction courses for the logic gates is OK. However, I am just struggling in the afternoon, the time when we are focusing on dealing with our logic gates assignment. I took nearly an hour with another people’s help to finish question8. That is a shame for me! I am now even having a doubt that am I really good at these things like electrical engineering? Can I be the best among my classmates if I choose electrical engineering in the university? It is just seeming not very possible as I thought before.

It is already 10 days past since I arrived America, arrived LA, arrived Baltimore, arrived JHU Homewood campus! Today we just have such a normal day. We have done our logic gate CMOS plate design this morning and unfortunately our group become the slowest one. We just don’t know why, although one of our team members have designed such an easy circuit that only contain only 3 NAND gates, which is quite easy and really interesting. Basically, his idea is that since whether left sensor detect lights, the right wheel just keeps moving, so only 3 logic gates is enough for controlling all the thing. We have met some problems about CMOS plate, but fortunately we figure out all the problems and it is working finally. We have truss classes this afternoon. Initially we met with Dr. Luana and Mr. Davis at Maryland Hall 201 to solve the problems that we have on Monday’s class. The truss question was quite difficult for me at first, but when I finally got the idea of ∑Fx, ∑Fy and ∑Momentum all equals 0, I found truss questions are actually easy to solve. We then go to Hackerman Hall to do our Bridge (Truss) Designer Tutorial and practice problems. Initially the truss simulator running on Chrome on the laptop that I am using is just totally dead for 3 different bridges. All of them are just showing errors “too few supports …” I was about to get crazy and I want to just throw away that computer. Fortunately, I get everything I want on Chrome. It is so lucky! Someone (Sam) is saying Edge sucks, but what the hell I should take care of. I went to the swimming pool tonight and meet many nice people. A new fish swimmer is running 100m consecutively each time, which couldn’t make me not to doubt that he is actually a professional swimmer. Jason is another friend I meet. He is also having summer school most in Medical Campus. He speaks Spanish as his first language. From him I have learned that the breaststrokes in Spanish is actually called braza. I swam 600m today, about 12 circles. Except for first two consecutive circles, I finished rest of circles when 1 circle 1 time. I can now finish 100m with about 1’38’’.

The second Saturday in Baltimore (although actually I am only able to enjoy 3 Saturday here, which means a lot time passed!). We simply stayed at our dorm whole morning, and we went to The Inner Harbor in the afternoon. 4 of us travel as a group took a small boat to travel on the water to see the Inner Harbor, which spend us 25$. The Inner Harbor has quite a long history, which can be observed from the old 19th century aircraft carrier mooring inside the Inner Harbor. The Inner Harbor doesn’t have many places to visit or to play. We went to several shoe stores and I found that the same AJ13 is 50$ cheaper at the Gallery than that in the shoe store. I think myself really lucky because I didn’t buy it from shoe store which saves 50$, but the staff says they don’t have my size. What a pity! For other shoes, either too ugly or no my size. We went to a book store then and bought some sale books, which is quite cheap ($5 for 1 book but tax 6%). One is This Side of Paradise and another is the picture of Dorian Gray.

First half day that is rainy, first rainy morning, the seventh rain in Baltimore when I arrived. We have our second quiz today. Unfortunately, I still don’t get a perfect score. Although it shows a good percentage (204/220, 93%), will, actually is not quite good. I have been a bad student for so long time that I have forget whether it is normal and mandatory for me to get a score higher than 95% or it is super good for me. I hope it is not my liit! After the quiz we start to build our paper mousetrap. Unfortunately, mine is not working because of too much friction. Definitely need to get a new model before Friday deadline! We have our first finance class this afternoon, which is also the second big class we have after the electronics lecture. The finance lecture this afternoon actually surprised me because it has a big difference from what I expected to. The deepest impression that EI gave me is that many of courses that previously I thought as a part that the program holders just want us to have some “classes” in this program, like a part to fill out the class schedule. For finance, I have expected to teach us some economic ideas like price mechanisms, Inflation rates or something related to business. However, in the finance class this afternoon, the professor introduced a variety of algorithms to make a profit. All these beautiful and complicated logarithms like the logarithm to get e (natural base number) let me understand why economics and finance courses can be classified as STEM classes. The essence of whether finance, economics or business is a general rule or result gotten as a conclusion that is calculated using a series of mathematical formulas, such as price elasticity of demand/supply. Logic essence of price mechanism and government policies makes all these financial and economical knowledges convincing and looks reasonable. The special lecture held this afternoon is spoken by a counselor, Miss Bianca Decatur, who is responsible for California’s applicant. Yes, this school is sexy and gorgeous, especially for those biomedical applicants. The university has a high teacher-student ratio (teacher: student 1:7) and a relatively small class range like we have in EI (24 people in one class). This is a school that really supports student research. With only 10% of international students in all of the university undergraduates, 72% of the undergraduates get internships when studying in JHU. Someone even gets a paid internship. You can even apply for up to $10,000 in off-campus research funding. The life for undergraduate students in such a rich school is just like a dream. However, the upper and lower quartiles of the SAT that are extremely high (1480-1550). It is not unreasonable to be a partner of Ivy League School for Johns Hopkins University. Unfortunately, Hopkins’s strongest professional, biomedical engineering, is not my point of interest. What a pity. Otherwise, this can really be said to be a dream school for me. I have swum 1600m tonight, which is much longer than I swam previous days. I swam 1500m of 1600m continuously and it takes me about 35’33’’73’’’. Actually, I finished 1500m within 32’30’’ because I need to change my direction (arriving the 2 sides of swimming pool). Each change takes about 3s. I need to hurry up in order to finish 1500m within 30min! Hurry up tomorrow!","link":"/2019/07/08/7.8 EN/"},{"title":"7.9","text":"第一次差点在上午的课上睡着的一天。今天早上的lecture教授了一些基本的化学常识（比如摩尔质量）。这是为了下午的三个实验做准备的，为了避免有潜在的高中没有选秀化学的同学不会在下午做实验的时候一脸懵逼……所以我们下午的实验一个是测量加热水的时候的热值转换效率，一个蒸馏，还有一个色谱实验……Excuse me？为什么全部都是IG阶段的实验… 继上一次拿到IG computer science的逻辑电路门复习提纲以后，今天我是真的有点心累了… 难道我真的这么差嘛？只配在这么高端的学校，课程和同学一起做这种低端实验吗？最骚的是还很少拿满分… 下午的实验最搞笑的就是煮意大利面和烤意大利面了。Zuck一不小心把一截意大利面丢进了电烙铁和电烙铁下面支架中间的地方，直接把面给烤成金黄（没错，所有亲历者都馋哭了）。一人掰了一小段吃，惊奇的发现味道还可以，还有一点咸咸的像起司一样，真的是太滑稽了。没错，烤的比水煮的好吃到不知道那里去了，因为水煮的只有外面软了，里面还是硬的。最骚的是我们后面准备二次烤制的时候把意大利面烧着了… 于是整个实验室里都散发着意大利面的香味，勾引者每个人肚子里的馋虫。 下午课结束以后好歹是套了一些老师的词。加油，套词的时间不多了，还要争取推荐信呢。下午的special lecture讲了一种发绿光的蛋白质.. 没错，又是生物。教授是一位南亚次大陆的人，这一点从他的脸部特征就可以看出来。同样的，还有他的口音。 晚上又游了1500m。同样的，左腿一游多就开始有一点要抽筋的感觉，真的很恐怖。另外还被隔壁一道的女选手（没错他会不触壁水下换向… 我丢失的技能包！！！）在速度，美感及泳姿的多样性上完虐了。真的伤心。唯一有点欣慰的是今天的手表计时为32’13’’53’’’,比昨天快了三分钟。一天三分钟，追上孙杨不是梦。 差不多是时间滚去睡觉了。","link":"/2019/07/09/7.9 CH/"},{"title":"July9th","text":"The first time that almost fall asleep in a morning lecture!!! This morning‘s lecture is about some basic chemical knowledge (such as molar mass). This is for the three experiments we need to do in the afternoon. In order to avoid potential students who do not choose chemistry in their high school among my classmates. Otherwise, they may have no idea of the experiments in the afternoon. The thing is, all 3 experiments in the afternoon is everything in an IGCSE chemistry book: measuring time and temperature rise of heating water in order to get efficiency of heating water in that pot, a distillation experiment, and a chromatographic experiment…Excuse me? Why are all experiments in the IGCSE level? In the summer of the second year at high school, I am now doing the experiment I should do in year 1, which made me feel embarrassed. We accidently roasted and cooked some spaghetti this afternoon. The roast one that is accidently made by Zachary is actually quite good. It tastes a little salty and it taste similar to a cheese! We separate the spaghetti and eat it. All of my classmates think that one is actually delicious. Ethen try to produce more after finish the experiment, but he just gets messy (spaghetti get burned slightly). That is just unfortunate! I finally have a relatively long talk with Fr. Shaffer. Hurry up, I need to catch up more this kind of chance to let her know me deeper. Today’s special lecture is about some green proteins… Actually, biology again. So shame for me because I don’t really interest in biology! I swam 1500m tonight, as usual. Same as yesterday, when I had swum 600m (even earlier than yesterday, and there is a little cramping feeling at 1000m yesterday), the left leg starts to have a feeling of cramping, which scares me a lot. I am afraid to use my left leg in the remaining part while I am afraid to use my right leg much stronger than left leg, which is ugly! Tonight, I was totally being defeated by a female swimmer next door (she can switch directions underwater!) Whether the swimming speed, style beautifulness and swimming style (standard action while switching between freestyle / breaststroke / butterfly / backstroke naturally and smoothly. Even worse for me is that she swam a lot faster than me whenever using what styles! I am so sad.) I felt so sad tonight. The only thing that made me happy tonight is: According to timing on my watch, I swam 1500m within 32’13’’53’’’ tonight, which is three minutes faster than yesterday! If I can boost up three minutes every day I swam, it seems that catching up with Sun Yang’s World record is not a dream for me (oh no man stops gossiping and swim within 30 minutes next time before building up such an impossible task). HaHa, I am just joking. I hope that I will not be sleepy on tomorrow’s lecture! Good night!","link":"/2019/07/09/7.9 EN/"},{"title":"my first article","text":"This is my first blog.
