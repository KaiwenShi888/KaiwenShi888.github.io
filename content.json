Today is the 2nd day in Engineering Innovation. In the morning class professor Luana introduces us some basic operating technique of excels. Since I am a new fish on excel, although organizing data, performing calculation and visualization is just the most basic function that excel provide, I am so supervised about that. We then get some small exercises which helps me to be familiar with, for example, how to drag values so that I can get a consecutive data set quickly and how to use the formula appropriately so that it can help me to save so much time on calculating the data I need with paper and pen. We then have an assignment, which is a list of 20 hypothetical colleges and 12 pieces of data. Our task is to come out a ranking system with our own logarithms that reflects what I consider most important in a college. By giving different weights to different data, I successfully come out a big chart and a perfect table with universities’ ranking and their marks on it. In the afternoon, we go back to our lab (actually we are in the Computer lab this morning when finishing the “university ranking system” task) where we prepared spaghetti device yesterday for testing different spaghettis’ tensions and bending. Unfortunately, 1 spaghetti and 1 “angel hair” (the thinnest spaghetti) prepared yesterday for testing tensions have already broken. However, Annie, Aysia and me have down perfect experiments. We get the data we want accurately in such a short period of time. One thing that is annoying me that the small steel ball used as weight is just fading, which made my hand turns almost totally black after we finished our experiment. I also went to a special lecture this afternoon, which is related to biomedical engineering. The lecturer, Ms. Soojung Claire Hur, has a legendary study experience and she works so hard that she left her steps in a Korea university, UCLA and Harvard. Now she is currently an Assistant Professor in JHU. Her speech refreshes my idea about biomedical engineering. Biomedical engineering is like a combination of electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and Biology, which requires much more hard work than many other subjects like pure electrical engineering. Really looking forward to tomorrow’s class!

I have taken an UA flight (UA 199) from Shanghai in June 22nd and arrive LAX at June 22nd 16:31(LA local time); after wait for 5h48min we finally get departure from LAX at 22:55. After a nearly 5h flight trip I finally arrived Baltimore in June 23rd! The first day of EI is quite good. Today professor Luana Scheffer give us an experiment assignment in the morning, which is basically fix up the apparatus to prepare for Tension test of different spaghetti. Me and two female working partners set up the apparatus quickly and successfully and it is actually quite fun. In the afternoon, Miss Luana teach us some basic knowledges about material engineering. Stress, Strain, Young��s modulus… I am familiar with about a half of them from the Cambridge A-level Physics textbook, which is taught by Mr. Eric in my school. However, I am not familiar with some brand-new knowledge like Toughness, Yielding, Strength in bending and several relationship formulas. Moreover, I have also learned a new unit: psi, which represents pounds per square. It is almost the same with the unit Pascal, but since Chinese use neither pounds nor inch in our daily life, I feel quite interesting when I first know what is ��psi�� represents, since I have seen them on the bag of Lay��s potato chips. To me, the most challenging part is the new relationship formula I get. The constants and the position of each parameters in the fractions takes time for me to remember. The most unfortunate part in today��s activities is that our group��s spaghetti structure for holding a cotton sugar get collapsed just before the time is up (about 1 or 2 seconds before professor Luana calls ��times up!��). We are given some tape, 20 spaghetti sticks and a cotton thread to create our structure. We can win if the accident doesn��t happens! Really looking forward to tomorrow��s class!
